%
% Configures the MPC terminal cost ingredient and optionally enables the
% use of ellipsoidal terminal set contraints.
%
% The terminal cost adds the following penalty on the final state of the 
% MPC Prediction Horizon:
%
%   J += (ref_xN - xN)' * P * (ref_xN - xN)
%
% where the terminal cost weight P is computed internally from the solution
% to a discrete Ricatti equation, obtained from:
%
%   P = dlqr(mpc.A,mpc.B,Qx,Ru),
%
% xN is the final state on the MPC prediction horizon and ref_xN is
% the desired value for the MPC final state. ref_xN is to be introduced on
% mpc_solve() during runtime MPC execution.
%
% If the terminal set constraint is enabled, CHRONOS enforces the following
% ellipsoidal terminal set constraint:
%
%   (ref_xN - xN)' * P * (ref_xN - xN) <= 1
%
% IMPORTANT: before calling this function you must ensure that the dynamics
% of the mpc have been initialized with representative values. Proper
% initialization can be done during the call to init_mpc_system() or by 
% modifying the MPC struct fields mpc.A and mpc.B manually.
%
% In:
%   - mpc: CHRONOS mpc structure
%   - Qx: nx x nx matrix, dLQR penalty on the states
%   - Ru: nu x nu matrix, dLQR penalty on the control action
%   - terminal_constraint: Boolean. If set to 1 the terminal set is added
%   to the list of constraints to be satisfied. NOTE: on the current state
%   of CHRONOS it is not advisible to enable terminal set constraints, once
%   slack variables have been added to CHRONOS the feasibility issues will
%   be solved
%   - x_ref_is_y: Boolean. In cases where the tracking signal is set to the
%   full state vector, e.g. y = C * x, setting x_ref_is_y to 1 allows you
%   to avoid defining ref_xN as a seperate argument on mpc_solve() during 
%   runtime MPC calls.
%
% Out:
%   - mpc: updated CHRONOS mpc structure
